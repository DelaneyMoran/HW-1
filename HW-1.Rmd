## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: Christian, Mohammed, Joy, Kyler, Phil
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW: 14h (over the two weeks)
* What gave you the most trouble: searching for the correct functions and syntax
* Any comments you have: I spent(wasted) a lot of time searching the internet for examples of how to do different things. I would have loved a better reference (or perhaps more extensive list of examples in the class exercises) that demonstrated different ways to manipulate different functions. 


## Question 1:

* Plot a "time series" of the proportion of flights that were delayed by > 30 minutes on each day.  i.e.
    + the x-axis should be some notion of time
    + the y-axis should be the proportion.
* Which seasons did we tend to see the most and least delays of > 30 minutes.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
number_delayed <- filter(flights, dep_delay >30) %>% 
  select(date, dep_delay) %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(n_delayed = n)

total_flights_day <- group_by(flights, date) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(total_flights = n)

set1 <- full_join(total_flights_day, number_delayed, by = "date")

set1<- mutate(set1, prop = (n_delayed)/(total_flights))

plot1 <- ggplot(data = set1, aes(x = date, y = prop)) + geom_point(stat = "identity", size = 1) + 
  geom_smooth(level = 0) + xlab("Date") + ylab("Proportion of Flights Delayed > 30min")  + 
  ggtitle("Proportion of Total Flights Delayed Per Day")

plot1

```

The most departure delays, suprisingly, occurred in the summer months, not the winter months. Perhaps this has to do with the relative mildness of Houston winters. Note also the dip in delays in the fall.    


## Question 2:

Some people prefer flying on older planes.  Even though they aren't as nice,
they tend to have more room.  Which airlines should these people favor?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

planes_2 <- planes %>%  select(plane, year)
flights2 <- flights %>% select(date, carrier, plane)

set2 <- left_join(flights2, planes_2, by = "plane") %>%
  filter(!is.na(year)) %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>% 
  mutate(average = 0)

avg <- aggregate(year ~ carrier, set2, mean) %>% 
  mutate(average = 1)

set2 <- bind_rows(set2, avg)

plot2 <- ggplot(set2, aes(x = carrier, y = year, color = as.factor(average))) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) + coord_flip() + xlab("Carrier") + ylab("Year") +
  scale_fill_manual(breaks = c(0, 1), labels = c("All Planes", "Average Year")) + ggtitle("Age of Planes by Carrier")
plot2


```

Each red dot represents a plane according to its year, and gives a sense of the range of options. The blue dots represent the average year of planes for each carrier. (The legend on the side should read: "All Planes" and "Average Year" instead of 0 and 1, but I did not have time to debug why that did not work). I also would have liked to arrange them in order by average year, and tried to fiddle around with that too, but couldn't get it. 
However, overall, American Airlines, US Air, and Delta have the highest proportions of older planes.



## Question 3:

* What states did listed Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?
* What states did all Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
flights_WN <- select(flights, date, time, carrier, dest) %>% 
  filter(carrier == "WN")

airports2 <- select(airports, iata, state)

flights_WN <- left_join(flights_WN, airports2, by = c("dest" = "iata")) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(state)) 

all_flights <- flights_WN %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(all_flights_state = n)

all_flights$state <- factor(all_flights$state, 
                           levels = all_flights$state[order(all_flights$all_flights_state)])

ggplot(all_flights, aes(x = state, y = all_flights_state)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  xlab("Destination State") + 
  ylab("Number of Flights") + 
  ggtitle("State Destinations of All Southwest Airlines Flights")


unique_flights <- flights_WN %>%
  distinct(dest) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(unique_dest = n)

unique_flights$state <- factor(unique_flights$state, levels = unique_flights$state[order(unique_flights$unique_dest)])

ggplot(unique_flights, aes(x = state, y = unique_dest)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("State") +
  ylab("Number of Unique Flights") +
  ggtitle("Listed Possible Southwest Flights")

```

The top plot shows the number of individual flights from Houston arriving in each state. We can see that the vast majority of all flights stay within Texas.

The bottom plot shows the number of different destination airports in each state. Again, there are many unique destinations within Texas. However, there is also a considerable number of flights that go to Florida and California, but as we see in the top plot, the ones within Texas fly more freqently; there are approximately fourfold the number of individual flights going to Texas vs. Florida, though only 3 more unique flights to Texas compared to Florida. 



## Question 4:

What weather patterns are associated with the biggest departure delays?

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
flights3 <- flights %>% select(date, hour, dep_delay)
weather3 <- weather %>% 
  select(date, hour, temp, visibility, wind_speed, conditions)

question3 <- left_join(flights3, weather3, by = c("date", "hour")) %>% 
  group_by(conditions) %>% 
  filter(conditions %in% c("Clear", "Freezing Rain", "Heavy Rain", "Light Freezing Rain", "Thunderstorms and Rain", "Thunderstorm", "Light Thunderstorms and Rain", "Heavy Thunderstorms and Rain")) %>% 
  summarise(avg.delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(question3, aes(x = conditions, y = avg.delay)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust=1)) +
  xlab("Weather Conditions") +
  ylab("Average Departure Delay (min)") +
  ggtitle("Conditions Associated with the Worst Departure Delays") +
  geom_hline(yintercept= 8.91, col="red", size=.5)

tempflights <- left_join(flights3, weather3, by = c("date", "hour")) %>% 
  mutate(temperature = round(temp)) %>% 
  group_by(temperature) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(num_del = n)

tempdelays <- left_join(flights3, weather3, by = c("date", "hour")) %>% 
  filter(dep_delay > 30) %>% 
  mutate(temperature = round(temp)) %>% 
  group_by(temperature) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(flights_delayed = n)

weatherdata <-left_join(tempflights, tempdelays, by = "temperature") %>% 
  mutate(prop = flights_delayed/num_del)

ggplot(weatherdata, aes(x = temperature, y = prop)) + 
  geom_line(stat = "identity") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 32, col="red") +
  ylab("Proportion of Flights Delayed > 30min") +
  ggtitle("Delayed Flights by Temperature")


```

The top plot indicates that Freezing Rain (and "Light Freezing Rain") are associated with the longest departure delays. The red line indicates the baseline average delay associated with "Clear" weather.It would have been interesting to plot the proportion increase in delay time by each condition, rather than just the average delay. 

Since freezing rain appears to be the most unfavorable condition, the second plot shows the proportion of delayed flights by temperature. The vertical line marks 32 degrees, and we can see the spike of delays that occurs just below the freezing point. 


## Question 5:

I want to know what proportionately regions (NE, south, west, midwest) each 
carrier flies to from Houston in the month of July.  Consider the `month()`
function from the `lubridate` package.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
Houston_flights <- select(flights, date, carrier, dest) %>% 
  mutate(month = month(date)) %>% 
  filter(month == 7) %>% 
  left_join(airports2, by = c("dest" = "iata")) %>% 
  left_join(states, by = "state") %>% 
  group_by(carrier)

H_flights_all <- Houston_flights %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(total_by_region = n)
#how to make this count regions that are not there!

Houston_flights_regions <- Houston_flights %>% 
  group_by(carrier, region) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(by_region = n)

set5 <- left_join(H_flights_all, Houston_flights_regions, by = "carrier") %>% 
  mutate(prop = by_region/total_by_region)

ggplot(set5, aes(x= carrier, y = prop, fill = region)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + xlab("Carrier") + 
  ylab("Proportion of Total Flights") +
  ggtitle("Flight Breakdown by Region")

ggplot(set5, aes(x= carrier, y = prop, fill = region)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge") + xlab("Carrier") + 
  ylab("Proportion of Total Flights") +
  ggtitle("Flight Breakdown by Region2")

```
The top graph is a difficult-to-read representation of the fraction of flights from each airline that fly to each region. In the second graph, I was trying to display the proportions next to each other rather than stacked, but could not figure out how to make sure each airline had a bar for every region, so that all the bars are the same width.
