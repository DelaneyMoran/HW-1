# Homework 1

You are currently in the GitHub repo for HW-1. Please refer to the [HW
Submission 
Exercise](https://github.com/Middlebury-Data-Science/HW-0#hw-submission-exercise)
from HW-0 on how to submit your assignment. This homework will cover the 
following topics:

* Data manipulation using `dplyr`
* Basic data visualization using `ggplot2`
* Reproducible research using R Markdown
* The importance of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**





## Administrative Notes

1. Please commit/push (i.e. submit) only a **compiling** `HW-1.Rmd` file. If a
part of your code is not working, comment it out.
1. Please acknowledge all collaborators, how much time you spent, etc, in the
Administrative section of `HW-1.Rmd`
1. Important dates:
    + First revision due:
    + HW due:
    + Second revision due:
1. To get out of project, change top right.





## Tips

1. It's best to do your initial work in a new R script file and after you're
done, start copying things over to the `HW-1.Rmd` file.
1. While doing your initial work, set the working directory to be the root
directory of your project:
    + Navigate to the folder `HW-1` in the File panel
    + Click *More* -> *Set As Working Directory*
1. Work in groups. 
1. One skill you'll be developing is having good **programming practices**. For
example, Google has their own [R Style 
Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml). Give it a
look, but don't worry about getting it all right the first time, I'll be giving 
feedback as the semester progresses.
1. Google is a programmer's best friend!
1. Do not spin your wheels: Donâ€™t be stuck for more than 20 minutes.
This takes self-awareness and mindfulness. After 20 minutes of frustration, take
a break and/or seek help.
